Weight Tracker App

**CS 360 Module Eight Journal Reflection**
App Requirements and Goals
The goal of my mobile app, Weight Tracker UI, was to help users monitor their current and goal weights in an intuitive, user-friendly way. The app was designed for individuals looking to track their weight progress over time, set goals, and visualize their journey. This addressed a user need for a simple tool to support personal health and fitness goals, especially for those who want quick, clear feedback on their progress.

**User-Centered UI and Features**
To support user needs, I designed and implemented screens including a login page, a dashboard displaying current and goal weights, and input screens for updating weight data. Features like clear visual indicators of progress, validation for user input, and organized layouts kept the user experience simple and engaging. My designs focused on visual hierarchy to ensure that important information stood out and navigation felt natural. By prioritizing ease of use, I believe the designs were successful in helping users stay motivated and confident using the app.

**Coding Approach and Strategies**
My coding approach was grounded in careful planning and modular development. I divided the app into components such as login authentication, data handling, and UI updates, coding each piece step by step. I used Android Studio best practices, including SensorManager integration and dynamic UI updates. Strategies like prototyping layouts and implementing input validation were essential, and I plan to use these techniques in future projects to ensure maintainability and scalability.

**Testing for Functionality**
I tested my app by running it on virtual devices with different screen sizes and configurations to ensure consistent performance. I also manually tested user interactions, such as entering data, navigating between screens, and handling invalid inputs. This testing was critical because it uncovered subtle UI issues and bugs early on, allowing me to refine the app before finalization. Comprehensive testing helps ensure apps meet both technical requirements and user expectations.

**Overcoming Challenges**
Throughout development, one major challenge was handling permissions, especially implementing and troubleshooting SMS permission requests for notifications. I had to research and experiment with permission handling to avoid crashes and provide smooth user experiences. Innovating solutions to permissions and ensuring compatibility across devices required persistence and adaptability.

**Demonstrating Skills and Knowledge**
I was particularly successful in demonstrating my knowledge and skills through the dynamic dashboard screen, which integrates real-time updates of current and goal weights with user-friendly feedback. This component showcases my ability to combine thoughtful UI design with solid coding practices, resulting in a polished feature that directly addresses user needs.
